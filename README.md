# LSTM Autocomplete

This project trains a character-level LSTM neural network to autocomplete text based on a sequence of characters. It uses Frankenstein by Mary Shelly to learn character patterns and generate new literary-style sequences.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Character-level one-hot encoding  
- 2-layer LSTM with dropout  
- Beam search text generation  
- Supports training on combined datasets (e.g. Frankenstein + Shakespeare)  
- Auto-save and load trained model to avoid retraining  

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn
